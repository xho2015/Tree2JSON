# Tree2JSON
A lightweight Tree to JSON string Serializer which implemented by C#. this can be easily integrated into code if a 3rd party library is NOT desired


this scriptlet can be freely copy, modify or distrabute in your code.

However, Please take below into consideration:
 
The C# runtime enginee have limited size of method stack frame, meaning that if the tree size are too huge, then it most likely exceed the stack size when traverse the whole nodes tree for generating JSON string.
